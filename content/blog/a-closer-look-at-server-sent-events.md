Server-Sent Events (SSE) which first appeared in the HTML5 specification in late 2009 is relatively new are a simple and efficient way for a server to PUSH data to a client in real-time over HTTP.
The goal of this article is to give you an overview on where the technology currently sits and what are some possible usecases to introduce it.

Here's a glimpse of what we will be going through

## Looking at the [HTML5 Specification](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/server-sent-events.html#server-sent-events)

SSE enables a server to send data to a client by "server push". The client establishes an HTTP connection to a server and keeps the connection open. The server can then continouslly send messages. A message is terminated by a blank line (two line terminators in a row). The data transfer mode is uni-directional beacause only the "server" is allowed to send data after establisihing a connection.

Here's how a sample SSE stream looks like

## What's in it for me?

Although realtively knew, SSEs can be a viable solution. The offer various advantages:

- Low latency and real-time updates
- Simple and efficient server-to-client communication
- Improved scalability and reduced server load

A perfect use-case for SSE is the "notification tab üîî" which is present on every kind of product nowadays. A server can be configured to push notifications to any client every time something happens in the product. For e.g you can award users with points every time they complete a step of onboarding.

## Limitations of Server-Sent Events

- Limited browser support
- Lack of support for older browsers
- Security concerns

## A look at other real-time communication technologies

- WebSockets
- AJAX
- Long Polling
- WebRTC

### Implementing a SSE Webserver in Go

Let's get down to some business, in this section we will be using [r3labs/sse](https://github.com/r3labs/sse) to implement a simple SSE webserver.
Let's start by importing the said package and initialising a SSE server.

```go
package main

import (
	"log"
	"net/http"
	"sse-poc/instance"
	"time"

	"github.com/r3labs/sse/v2"
)

func logHTTPRequest(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
	log.Printf("Got trigger request. Sending SSE")

	server := instance.SSEServer()
	server.Publish("messages", &sse.Event{
		Data: []byte(time.Now().String()),
	})
	w.Header().Add("Access-Control-Allow-Origin", "*")
	w.WriteHeader(200)
}

func main() {
  server := sse.New()
  // disable replaying old events to new clients
  server.AutoReplay = false
  server.Headers = map[string]string{
  	"Access-Control-Allow-Origin":  "*",
  	"Access-Control-Allow-Methods": "GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, OPTIONS",
  }

	server.CreateStream("messages")

	mux := http.NewServeMux()
	mux.HandleFunc("/events", server.ServeHTTP)
	mux.HandleFunc("/trigger", logHTTPRequest)

	addr := ":8080"
	log.Println("Starting server on", addr)

	err := http.ListenAndServe(addr, mux)
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatal(err)
	}

}
```

### Implementing a SSE client using `EventSource`

        function triggerEvent() {
            fetch('http://127.0.0.1:8080/trigger', {
                method: 'GET',
            })
        }

        var btn = document.getElementById("triggerEvents");
        btn.addEventListener("click", triggerEvent);

        // Read SSE logic
        const evtSource = new EventSource('http://127.0.0.1:8080/events?stream=messages');
        const eventList = document.querySelector('ul');

        evtSource.onmessage = (e) => {
            const newElement = document.createElement("li");

            newElement.textContent = `message: ${e.data}`;
            eventList.appendChild(newElement);
        }
    </script>
</body>
