## Introduction

Deploying a Backend/Fronted app can be a daunting task, especially if you're not familiar with the process. There are a lot of different factors to consider, such as the choice of technology stack, the hosting provider, and the deployment methodology.

There are a number of different SaaS products available that can help you deploy your backend and frontend. Some of the most popular options include:

-Heroku
-Netlify
-AWS Elastic Beanstalk
-Google App Engine

If you're looking for a way to simplify the deployment process, then you should consider using [Buildndeploy](https://buildndeploy.co/), for rest of the blog we will be using short form BnD for [Buildndeploy](https://buildndeploy.co/). It is a Saas application that takes care of hosting/auto-deploying your application with the ease of just ```git push``` command  so that you can focus on more important logics of your application rather then getting confused in the vast world of devops.


## Lets deploy üöÄ

To get started we first need an application that we can deploy if you already have one you can simply use that, assuming that you are new to all this I am going to create a new React application and deploy that to [BnD](https://buildndeploy.co/).

So there are two ways to do that, since [BnD](https://buildndeploy.co/) require some custom configured docker files either we can use build and deploy platform to create a github repo for us or we can create one by ourself and deploy that to [BnD](https://buildndeploy.co/) using github. Lets Explore with [BnD](https://buildndeploy.co/) first.

### Method 1 üëæ

Head on to [BnD](https://buildndeploy.co/) and your dashboard should look something like this:

![Alt text](img/homepageBnd.png "buildndeploy homepage")

Now you have to select ```New Project``` button and select ```New Project``` option, you will be given two fields, enter the Name you would like in first field and select the framework whose boilerplate you want to generate. ( P.S. If you didn't find the framework you are looking for you can head to ```Method 2``` right away, since I am using Reactjs in this demo they already have support for that. )

![Alt text](img/bndOptionsAutoGenCode.png "Autogen Repo")

Along with Reactjs they have boilerplate support for Angular.js, Next.js, Golang and Node.js apps ( On time of writing this blog ). Don't worry your language will be here soon

Once you have successfully completed the process you will notice that in your github you have a repository with the same name that you gave to you app, on top of that your repo gets auto deployed on [BnD](https://buildndeploy.co/). Now you can clone your repo locally make some changes and push, voila !!!! just like that your code is auto deployed to the cloud.

Your project's home page on [BnD](https://buildndeploy.co/) will look something like this depending on what framework you choose.

### Method 2 üßëüèª‚Äçüíª
Head on to your teminal and create a new React application with the following command:
```bash
$ npx create-react-app my-app
```
after it has finished its execution you will see this message refering that a new project has been initialized with name ```my-app```:
```bash
$ Success! Created my-app at /Users/Username/my-app
Inside that directory, you can run several commands:

  npm start
    Starts the development server.

  npm run build
    Bundles the app into static files for production.

  npm test
    Starts the test runner.

  npm run eject
    Removes this tool and copies build dependencies, configuration files
    and scripts into the app directory. If you do this, you can‚Äôt go back!

We suggest that you begin by typing:

  cd my-app
  npm start
```
Now the next step is you initialize a git repository in it so that you can import that into [BnD](https://buildndeploy.co/) and after that every time we push we get a fresh new build. Run the following command:

```bash
$ cd my-app && git init
```
You can do desired changes to the application and then push it to the github, we are also going to add 2 more files to our frontend and that will help the platform to deploy our project. You can copy and paste the following files directly to root directory of the project which in my case is ‚Äúmy-app‚Äù:

* nginx.conf: This is the default file that will take care of nginx configurations of your project.
```conf
user  nginx;
worker_processes  auto;
error_log  /var/log/nginx/error.log warn;
pid        /var/run/nginx.pid;
events {
    worker_connections  1024;
}
http {
    include       /etc/nginx/mime.types;
    default_type  application/octet-stream;
    log_format  main  '$remote_addr - $remote_user [$time_local] "$request" '
    '$status $body_bytes_sent "$http_referer" '
    '"$http_user_agent" "$http_x_forwarded_for"';
    access_log  /var/log/nginx/access.log  main;
    sendfile        on;
    #tcp_nopush     on;
    
    keepalive_timeout  65;
    #gzip  on;
    #include /etc/nginx/conf.d/*.conf;
    server {
        listen 80;
        location / {
            root   /usr/share/nginx/html;
            index  index.html index.htm;
            try_files $uri $uri/ /index.html;
        }
    }
}
```

* Dockerfile: this file will dockerize your application, it's inclusion is required as [BnD](https://buildndeploy.co/) uses it to deploy your application.
```Dockerfile
FROM node
WORKDIR /src
COPY . ./
RUN npm install -f && npm run build

FROM nginx:stable-alpine
COPY --from=0 /src/dist /usr/share/nginx/html
COPY nginx.conf /etc/nginx/nginx.conf
EXPOSE 80
CMD ["nginx", "-g", "daemon off;"]
```
now we will commit and push the changes and head on to the [BnD](https://buildndeploy.co/) platform.

After you have Signup on the platform you will see a page like this, I already happen to have a project deployed but if you are new user yours will look empty ( just like my brain sometimes ü•≤ ) :

![Alt text](img/homepageBnd.png "buildndeploy homepage")

click on ```New Project``` button and you will be presented with two options either you can ‚ÄúCreate a New App‚Äù or you can ‚ÄúUse an Existing App‚Äù. Since we already had deployed our app on github we will choose ```Import Repository``` option and it will present us with a screen where we can choose which Repo to deploy :

![Alt text](img/deployBnd.png "buildndeploy homepage")

from here we will search and choose our repo that we just pushed to, and it will take us to the part to configure our application:

![Alt text](img/projectConfigure.png "buildndeploy homepage")

here you will have option to choose 
- Set you projcet name and choose its core language ( required for build commands )
- Set your build configurations, since we already have our docker file ready we can go ahead without editing any of these options
- Set the port you want to expose your application to
- Add environment variables that you might be using in your project. we have a simple fronted UI so, we don't need to add any of that as well
- Choose custom domain, if you own any ( We can only add one custom domain at this time, it might change in the future ).

Hit ```Save``` button at the top and it will start deployment and you will see a page like this one below:

![Alt text](img/deploymentBnd.png "buildndeploy homepage")

once the ```running``` state changes to ```complete``` you can click and visit the marvelous ü•∫ app that you just created by clicking the URL under ```Deployment```. 


## Conclusion

Coding is all about using the right tools that fits your need and this might be exactly what you are looking for to deploy your backend and fronted.

Adios ‚úåüèª
